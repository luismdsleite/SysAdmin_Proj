# LDAP
[Simple Explanation of what is OpenLDAP, LDAP, slapd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8BwMlPRMF8)

LDAP = X.500 + TCP/IP

## Attributes 
- CN = Common Name
- OU = Organizational Unit
- DC = Domain Component
- DN = Distinguished Names 
- C = country

</figure>

## Object Classes
Set of attributes
- Person = CN + SN
- Country = C
Note: Optional attributes are also possible in object classes

## Schemas  
Plugins (Attributes + Object Classes)
- PosixAccount composed by: VID, Shell, home, GID
Note: PosixAccount = Object class Used in /etc/passwd composed by attributes

The slapd configuration is stored as a special LDAP directory with a predefined schema and DIT. There are specific objectClasses used to carry global configuration options, schema definitions, backend and database definitions, and assorted other items
